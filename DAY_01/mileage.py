  Problem Statement:
    Assume my car travels 100 Kilometres after putting 5 litres of fuel. 
    Calculate the average of my car. 
    Hint: 
    Divide kilmeters by the litres used to get the average
    
  #distance that car travels 
    cartravels=100
# fuel required to travel 100km distance
    fuelrequired=5
  #average of car
    average=100/5
    print(average)
