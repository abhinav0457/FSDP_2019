    Assume you travel 80 km to and fro in a day. 
    Cost of Diesel per litre is 80 INR 
    Your vehicle Fuel Average is 18 km/litre. 
    Now calculate the cost of driving per day to office. 
  Hint: 
      #total distance travel in a day
      totaldistance=160
      #cost of diesel
      dieselcost=80
     #vehical average
      vehicalaverage=18
     #cost of driving per day 
      drivingcost=80/18*160
      print(drivingcost)
